# VentureChat2Dynmap

> VentureChat --> Dynmap chat relay

## Installation

1. Install VentureChat and Dynmap/LiveAtlas

2. Download binaries from releases or compile with Java8+: ./gradlew build.

## Usage

There are no options to configure. 
Messages from Minecraft running on VentureChat will be relayed to Dynmap.
Note that the relay is unidirectional; Dynmap chat is shown in-game just fine without this plugin.

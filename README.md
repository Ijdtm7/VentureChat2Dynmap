# VentureChat2Dynmap

> VentureChat --> Dynmap chat relay

## Installation

1. Install VentureChat and Dynmap/LiveAtlas

2. Binaries coming soon--compile with ./gradlew build (tested with OpenJDK 8).

## Usage

Messages from Minecraft running on VentureChat will be relayed to Dynmap just like Vanilla chat.
Note that the relay is unidirectional; Dynmap chat is shown in-game just fine without this plugin.
